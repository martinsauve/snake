# SNAKE

this is a simple snake implementation using raylib in C. The code is bad, this is a quick and dirty proof of concept because i somehow never implemented a snake before...

# HOW TO BUILD

Make sure you have make, gcc and curl installed on your system. (should be the case).
Clone the repo, cd into it and run:

```bash
   make
   ./snake
```

the Makefile will download raylib for you and build the project. Since it is static linking, you can move the binary wherever you want after that.
